what is boundary value testing | dai nhat
technique can be represented adequately for program | FSM
1900 and 2010 | 1899,1900,2010,2011
equivalent class | subsets in a partition
performance testing executed | system test
find the exact location of the defects in the program | diagnosis testing
what is a boundary | it is where two sub-domains meet
an interior point | it is a point belonging to a sub-domain but not on the boundary
CFT | execution path
FMS's concept | it is an activity that be performed at a given moment
EPC for an integer input sub-domain, 0 <= x < 200 | -1, 0, 100, 199, 200
testing divided into various sub-phases | each test sub-phase has a different purpose and techniques
performed depending on present state and input conditions | input action
create test cases in FSM testing | state transition diagram and state table
testing with checklists not applied for large system | the checklist cannot describe complex function of the system
what is alpha testing | it is performed by customers at the software dev
not an action type in FSMs concept | information storing action
equivalent class in partition-based testing | sub-domain
not reason that testing with checklists is not effectively for large | it is tracked what has been done
values less than 20 are rejected | 20, 25, 30
limitation of checklist-based testing | it needs additional information for re-test
point not in domain and not on boundary called | exterior point
not correct about weak N X 1 strategy | it uses n on points and 1 off points
not a generic method for information gathering and OP construction | test
true for "Equivalence partitioning" technique in unit test | it helps to reduce the number of test cases
not correct about DFT construction | DFT is process-oriented
data flow testing | it is the verification of correct handling of data relations during
following testing is used to ensure product reliability | usage-based statistical testing
not mandatory of a path | segment
not a relation of partition-based testing | coverage
what is a finite state machine | it is a model of behavior 
can fsm be classified by | input/output or state
elements is fsm composed of | states, transition and actions
checklist-based testing be stopped | every item on the checklist is tested and passed
branching node | it is a node associated with multiple outlinks
are static elements | states and state transitions
not the way for fsm testing | build separate state
boundary values testing | to test the boundaries that separate valid and invalid condition
not required to participate to operational profile | supporter
dynamic elements | input and output
